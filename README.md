# Introduction
Based on data provided by the city of Seattle, the purpose of this analysis to predict CO2 emissions and the total energy consumption of buildings for which they have not yet been measured using some machine learning algorithms (Extra Tree Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, Random Forest Regression)

# Approach
1. Dataset Presentation
2. Data 
3. Machine Learning
